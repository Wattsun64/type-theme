This may date me, but there is something about a side-scrolling video game that stands out to me. They have this certain feel. You can see the effort put into each character and level. In no way am I insulting the quality or the efforts put into games such as [Batman: Arkham City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman:_Arkham_City) or [Uncharted 2: Among Thieves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncharted_2:_Among_Thieves), those games are for another post. Personally side-scrollers stand out to me because of their simplicity and ability to challenge you in unique ways.

### Quick Definition

To those of you that have no idea what a [side-scrolling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-scrolling_video_game) game is, I'll quickly define it as a game in which gameplay is viewed from a side camera angle. Characters move from left-right and up-down to complete the stage. Pretty straight forward.

### The Beginnings

Similar to most gamers my age, I started off playing video games on the [SNES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System) gaming system. My first handheld was the [GameBoy Color](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Color). Needless to say, side-scrollers were all we had to work with. 3D games were starting to make their appearances on Playstation and Dreamcast, both systems I had limited access to. 


### The Ultimate Test

These games test you mentally, I don't think stress on your thumbs could be considered that much of a physical challenge. They would push you to the point of insanity. In fact the definition of insanity doesn't register to someone when playing a side-scroller. I can remember attempting the same jump in Super Mario World countless times because I knew that eventually I would time everything perfectly, and when I did, the words to describe the satisfaction couldn't be found because the next jump could be just as challenging.

### They're Addicting!

I can honestly say that playing one level of any side-scroller isn't enough to curb my gaming appetite. I'll play the same level over again to roam around and test out different tactics or search for hidden "rooms". If this is the only chance I get to discover untold secrets, I'll take it.

### They're Making a Comeback

When you look at the advancements in technology in regards to video games, it's remarkable. The level of detail that can be reached in games today is amazing! So amazing in fact that we tend to overlook side-scrolling games because we immediately think they will be too easy. When that is in no the case. If anything side-scrolling games have evolved with the advancements in gaming. 

[Cuphead](http://cupheadgame.com/) is a great example of what can be done with side-scrolling games. The design and feel is that of cartoons in the 1930's. You're essentially controlling a cartoon tv show. I don't know about the rest of you, but my mind is blown at the endless possibilities in bringing back cartoons from out childhood into well crafted video games. Batman: The Animated Series perhaps?....
