### My First Time

I started drinking coffee about 3 years ago. At one point I consider myself someone who did not need to consume coffee in order to function. I thought it was more for show...oh how wrong I was!

My first cup was with a coworker in the staff lounge. You know, where the cool kids hang out. My curiosity had finally reached it's peak and I asked, "How does this coffee thing work?" (I am very well spoken). My coworker proceeds to walk me through the steps:

    - Put this there
    - Put that there
    - Press this
    - Add two containers of this stuff

After following such precise instructions, my first cup of coffee was made. Like many others before me, I was nervous. I didn't know what to expect. I took my first sip... 

"Not bad," I said, "Not the worst thing I've tasted." 

My coworker tells me, "You're drinking a medium roast." 

"I'm drinking a what?!??" (as if I had just been told I consumed bleach)

"You're drinking a medium roast coffee, it's more balanced and has more acidity to it." 

"What does that even mean?!?!" I asked calmly.

We go back and forth a few more times. I won't bore you with the details, but afterwards my brain hurt.

### Epilogue

The hours that followed my initiation to coffee, was my journey into the rabbit hole. I spent the rest of the night experimenting with various types of coffee (light, medium, dark, hot chocolate, etc), as well as achieving a level of productivity never seen before.

My adventures in coffee continue to this day. I have since graduated to brewing my own coffee using various methods, [French Press](http://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-perfectly-robust-french-press-coffee-cooking-lessons-from-the-kitchn-113601) and [Pour Over](https://bluebottlecoffee.com/preparation-guides/pour-over). If there is one thing I've learned through my coffee encounters it is this, I will always remember my first time.
